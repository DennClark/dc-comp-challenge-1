The comp-challenge is about implementing HTML and CSS together to create a static webpage. The site kept the integrity of the original comp but included the content of my choosing. With tools like flex-box I made a site to pay homage to the greatest television series of all time "Mystery Science Theater 3000. The site includes a header and navbar with links to take you to separate pages, the lower portion of the site includes info on the characters in the series. With adding Js functionallity to the site we would be able to venture further into the site including a potential e-commerce section of the site.
